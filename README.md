# RDF2x


A collection of converters from RDF to data formats. An activity of [LOD2's WP9](http://lod2.eu/WorkPackage/wp9.html).

## Background

More and more data is being made available in [RDF](http://lod-cloud.net/state/), however, many tools out there used by professionals and semi-professionals alike, inlc. SPSS, MS Excel, etc. don't natively speak RDF.
In order to enable these tools to benefit from the vast amount of RDF data available on the Web and in the enterprises, we now develop a number of converters that take RDF as an input and convert it to data formats, such as SDMX, PC-Axis, CSV, etc.

## Others and nearby

* W3C Wiki lists some [converter from RDF](http://www.w3.org/wiki/ConverterFromRdf)
